# SendGrid Sender Verification Fix

## 🚨 **Current Issue:**
SendGrid is rejecting emails because the sender email `noreply@axys-banking.com` is not verified.

## ✅ **Quick Fix Applied:**
I've updated the sender email to use your Gmail address: `tamilarasann.1992@gmail.com`

## 🔧 **How to Properly Fix This:**

### **Option 1: Verify Your Gmail Address (Recommended)**

1. **Go to SendGrid Dashboard**
   - Visit [app.sendgrid.com](https://app.sendgrid.com)
   - Sign in with your account

2. **Navigate to Sender Authentication**
   - Go to Settings → Sender Authentication
   - Click "Single Sender Verification"

3. **Add Your Gmail**
   - Click "Create New Sender"
   - Enter: `tamilarasann.1992@gmail.com`
   - Enter your name: `Tamilarasan`
   - Click "Create"

4. **Verify Email**
   - Check your Gmail inbox
   - Look for verification email from SendGrid
   - Click the verification link
   - Status should show "Verified"

### **Option 2: Use a Custom Domain (Advanced)**

1. **Get a Domain**
   - Purchase a domain (e.g., `axys-banking.com`)
   - Set up DNS records

2. **Domain Authentication**
   - In SendGrid → Settings → Sender Authentication
   - Click "Authenticate Your Domain"
   - Follow DNS setup instructions

3. **Update Sender Email**
   - Change to: `noreply@yourdomain.com`

## 📧 **Current Configuration:**

The app is now configured to send emails from:
- **From Email**: `tamilarasann.1992@gmail.com`
- **From Name**: `Axys Banking`

## 🧪 **Test the Fix:**

1. **Try sending an OTP** in your app
2. **Check console logs** - Should show success
3. **Check your Gmail** - Should receive the OTP email

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting:**

### **If Still Getting 403 Error:**
- **Check verification status** in SendGrid dashboard
- **Wait a few minutes** after verification
- **Try a different email** if verification fails

### **If Verification Email Not Received:**
- **Check spam folder**
- **Try resending verification**
- **Contact SendGrid support**

## 📋 **Next Steps:**

1. **Verify your Gmail** in SendGrid dashboard
2. **Test email sending** in your app
3. **Check your inbox** for OTP emails
4. **Complete the signup flow** with real emails

## 🎯 **Expected Result:**

After verification, you should see:
```
LOG  Email sent successfully to: tamilarasann.1992@gmail.com
```

And receive a beautiful branded OTP email in your Gmail inbox!
